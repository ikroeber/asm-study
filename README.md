# My Assembly Studies

A few years ago, I started searching for good material regarding assembly. I spent a lot of time until I found my needle in the haystack. **[Exercism](https://exercism.org/)** is a non-profit organization. Their platform provides free practical learning tracks for more than 50 languages and technologies . And guess what?! They have an x86_64 assembly track!

From now on, I will be updating this repo with ```.asm``` files written throughout my studies and will also write about x86_64 NASM syntax and conventions on a Linux environments.
